    <description lang="en_US">Ever wondered what would happen to the saved game file of your favorite PS1 RPG if your SD Card gets corrupted once day ?
    Don't wait for that to occur. 
    
    BGS is a small application which will check the presence of saved games for a number of set emulators and native games, and save them all together for you, automatically, in a single-file archive on your SD Card. 
    It will also duplicate that file on your second SD Card (if inserted) in order to maximize data redundancy and avoid that you lose everything if one of your SD Card dies. It's rather unlikely that your second SD Card would get corrupted at the exact same time. 
    
    It currently supports backup up saved games for the following applications: 
    
- Gambatte, Gameboy emulator
- Pcsx_rearmed, PS1 emulator
- Drastic, DS emulator
- PPSSPP, PSP emulator
- gpSP, GBA emulator

- Scumm VM, LucasArts (and others) adventure games emulator

- Pewpew2, polygonal shooter
- Duke Nukem 3d, come get some
- 8Blitter, Master System/GameGear emulator
- Pushover
- Projectx, Forsaken-like game
